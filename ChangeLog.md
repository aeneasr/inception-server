Change Log for Inception Server
===============================

`inception-server` lets you create an inception server - a general purpose server on AWS or OpenStack that is great for deploying/developing/testing bosh and bosh releases

v0.4.0 - coming
---------------

-	AWS - Trusty 14.04 AMIs, which means Sydney region is fixed (had a bad 13.04 AMI)

v0.3.0
------

-	`inception share-ssh` makes it really easy to share access to an inception server. It displays text that can be copied & pasted to any person explaining how to setup local SSH config and a private key.

v0.2.0
------

-	Settings stored in `~/.inception_server` instead of `~/.bosh_inception`
-	Using [readwritesettings](https://github.com/drnic/readwritesettings) instead of settingslogic for access/save settings
-	install bosh-bootstrap & latest bosh-cloudfoundry --pre (v0.2.1)
-	using bosh-cloudfoundry 0.7.0 (not --pre releases) (v0.2.2)

Fixes:

-	Fixed running `deploy` after `delete` by removing `cookbooks.prepared` setting
-	Do not destroy local ~/.gitconfig when running tests

v0.1.0
------

-	Initial release to mailing list
-	Extracted from bosh-bootstrap v0.10.2
-	Settings stored in `~/.bosh_inception`
-	Chef cookbook `bosh_inception` replacing old bosh-bootstrap shell scripts
-	Using [cyoi](https://github.com/drnic/cyoi) to prompt for infrastructure/provider credentials
